### Overview
* Intro
* Figma
* Sections
* Future Upgrades
* GitPages link

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. You can play with the resolution of the screen and watch the page in few variations.
The links in this project react when the user hovering them and the photo grids and other element adjust themselves in order to look good in any resolution.
